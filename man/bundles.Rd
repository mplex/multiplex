Bundle Class Patterns
}
\description{
Classify the Bundle class patterns in a system of multiple relations
}
\usage{
bundles(x, loops = FALSE, smpl = FALSE, lb2lb = TRUE, 
        collapse = FALSE, sep)
}
\arguments{
  \item{x}{
   an array; usually with three dimensions of stacked matrices where the multiple relations are placed. 
}
  \item{loops}{
   (logical) whether or not the loops should be considered as a particular bundle
}
  \item{smpl}{
   (logical) simplify the strings of relations? Default no.
}
  \item{lb2lb}{
   (logical) should the labels of the nodes be included in the output? (default yes).
}
  \item{collapse}{
   (logical) collapse the distinct levels of relations in the network? (default no).
}
  \item{sep}{
   (optional) the pair separator for the pairwise relations
  }
}
\details{
A bundle is a particular type of pattern made of relations at different levels that is binding a pair of nodes or actors in a network of relationships. A bundle class is a dyadic configuration resulting from the mixture of the direction and the types of ties between the nodes or actors. There are in total seven dyadic configuration classes, which are \emph{null}, \emph{asymmetric}, \emph{reciprocal}, \emph{tie entrainment}, \emph{tie exchange}, \emph{mixed}, and the \emph{full} bundle pattern. This function provides detailed information about the bundle class patterns in multiple networks as lists of pair relations among the nodes or actors, except for the `null' pattern.

In case that the nodes are not labeled, then an identification number will be assigned according to the nodes' location in the array representation and as well when the \code{lb2lb} option is set to \code{FALSE}. This function assumes that the network is directed, and self ties can also be considered in the output.
Long string labels can be simplified with \code{smpl}, whereas the \code{collapse} option blurs the levels in the strings.

\note{
The input array for this function is always dichotomized, and it is possible to obtain the total number of occurrences in each bundle class pattern with the \code{\link{bundle.census}} function.

\examples{
## Create the data: two binary relations among three elements
arr <- round( replace( array(runif(18), c(3,3,2)), array(runif(18),
       c(3,3,2))>.8, 3 ) )

## Establish the different bundles
bundles(arr)
