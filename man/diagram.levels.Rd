\title{
Levels in the Lattice Diagram
}
\description{
This function reads the different levels in the lattice diagram of the partial order structure among actors and ties in the network.
}
\usage{
diagram.levels(x, perm = FALSE)
}
%- maybe also 'usage' for other objects documented here.
\arguments{
  \item{x}{
   A matrix representing the partial order
}
  \item{perm}{
   (optional) whether or not to return the permuted structure
   }
}
\details{
When it comes to reduce the structure of a multiple network, many times the partial order structure provides different classes of elements depending in the inclusions these elements have. In this sense, the illustration given by the \code{\link{diagram}} function provides us typically with different levels of the ordered relations, which are read by this routine.
}
\value{
A data frame with the elements of the partial order structure with the column names indicating the element class. If the permutation is specified, then a vector with the levels and a matrix with the permuted structure are given as well.

\note{
This function requires that the \emph{Rgraphviz} package is available. Besides, since the \code{pictex} function from \code{grDevices} is inside this routine, it implies counting with administrator privileges for running.
