\title{
The Word Table of Relations
}
\description{
The Word Table of multiple relations.
}
\usage{
wordT(x)
}
%- maybe also 'usage' for other objects documented here.
\arguments{
  \item{x}{
   an array; usually with three dimensions of stacked matrices where the multiple relations are placed.
}
}
\details{
  The Word Table is a consequence of the Edge Table and the function gives a list of indexed elements in the complete semigroup. 
  
  In terms of the Cayley graph of the semigroup, the collection of unique relations (both compound an generators) are represented by nodes, and the generators are edges that record the result of post-multiplying the compound relations by the generators (Pattison, 1993).
}
\value{
An object of the `\code{WordTable}' class
  \item{gens}{
   the generator relations
}
  \item{WT}{
   the Word Table where \code{"n"} stands for ``node'' and \code{"g"} stands for ``generator''
}

The generators do not have values neither in the ``node'' nor the ``generator'' of the Word table since they are not product of any other element in the semigroup. cf. details for the rest of the values.

\examples{
## Create the data: 2 binary relations among 3 elements
arr <- round( replace( array(runif(18), c(3,3,2)), array(runif(18),
       c(3,3,2))>.5, 1 ) )

## get the word table
wordT(arr)
