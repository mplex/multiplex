\title{
Galois Derivations Between Subsets
}
\description{
Function to perform Galois derivations between partially ordered subsets
}
\usage{
galois(x, labeling = c("full", "reduced"), sep, valued, scl, 
    sep2)
}
\arguments{
  \item{x}{
	a data frame with objects and attributes
}
  \item{labeling}{
	whether the derivations should be 
  \itemize{ 
    \item \code{full} for full labeling
    \item \code{reduced} for reduced labeling
  }
}
  \item{sep}{
   (optional) the pair separator for the pairwise relations
  }
  \item{valued}{
   (logical) whether the galois derivation is on a many-valued formal context
  }
  \item{scl}{
   (optional, only for valued) the scale to be used in the galois derivation
  }
  \item{sep2}{
   (optional, only for valued) the separator in the formal concept
  }
}
\details{
Galois derivations (or connections) are mappings between families of partially ordered subsets of elements. Such derivations are useful to analyze the structure of both subsets, which in a social network are typically the actors and their corresponding affiliations or events. That is, two-mode networks, but also a group of objects with a list of different attributes as used in formal concept analysis. 
}
\value{
A labelled list with Galois derivations of objects and attributes

\note{
Full labeling implies first objects and then attributes, whereas the reduced option is given the other way around.
