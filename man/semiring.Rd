\title{
Semiring Structures for Balance Theory
}
\description{
A function to construct semiring structures for the analysis of structural balance theory.
}
\usage{
semiring(x, type = c("balance", "cluster"), symclos = TRUE,
            transclos = TRUE, k = 2, lbs)
}
\arguments{
  \item{x}{  an object of a `\code{Signed}' class
}
  \item{type}{  balance or cluster semiring?
}
  \item{symclos}{  (logical) apply symmetric closure?
}
  \item{transclos}{  (logical) apply transitive closure?
}
  \item{k}{  length of the cycle or the semicycle
}
  \item{lbs}{  (optional) labels for the semiring output
}
}
\details{
Semiring structures are based on signed networks, and this function provides the capabilities to handle either the balance semiring or the cluster semiring within the structural balance theory.
%
A semiring combines two different kinds of operations with a single underlying set, and it can be seen as an abstract semigroup with identity under multiplication and a commutative monoid under addition. Semirings are useful to determine whether a given signed network is balanced or clusterable. The symmetric closure evaluates this by looking at semicycles in the system; otherwise, the evaluation is through closed paths. 
}
\value{

The items included are:
  \item{val}{the valences in the semiring}
  \item{s }{the original semiring structure}
  \item{Q }{the resulted semiring structure}
  \item{k }{the number of cycles or semicycles}

\examples{
## Create the data: two sets with a pair of binary relations 
## among three elements
arr <- round( replace( array( runif(18), c(3 ,3, 2) ), array( runif(18),
       c(3, 3, 2) ) > .5, 3 ) )

## Make the signed matrix with two types of relations
sg <- signed(arr)

## Establish the semiring structure
semiring(sg)
