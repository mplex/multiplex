\title{
Neighborhood of an actor or group of actors
}
\description{
A function to find the neighborhood of an actor or group of actors with a customized distance.
}
\usage{
neighb(x, rs, type = c("und", "inn", "out"), k = 1, inclx = FALSE, expand)
}
%- maybe also 'usage' for other objects documented here.
\arguments{
  \item{x}{
the reference actor labeled in \code{rs} or a vector of several actors
}
  \item{rs}{
the relational system of the network
}
  \item{type}{
  whether the network is \emph{undirected} (default) \code{und}; directed with \emph{incoming node}'s ties \code{inn} to the the reference actor, or else with \emph{outgoing} arcs \code{out}
}
  \item{k}{
  the ``distance'' of the neighbor nodes to the reference actor (where \code{k=1} gives the adjacent nodes)
}
  \item{inclx}{
  (logical) should the reference actor be included in the output?
}
  \item{expand}{
  (optional and logical) should the output be given by \code{k} (it only makes sense when \code{k>1})
}
}
\details{
The relational system serves to represent either the entire multiple network, or else just the relational bundles having a mutual or an asymmetric character. 
In this sense, this function detects the adjacent nodes to \code{x} according to the specified relational system, but as well the neighbours of the adjacent nodes with a customized length. 
Eventually, when the longest path or chain is reached, adding more value to \code{k} obviously will not produce more nodes in the graph system.
}
\value{
Depending on \code{expand}, either a vector or a list with the neighbour nodes to the reference actor(s).

\note{
In case that the reference actors are in different components of the network, the output does not discriminate this fact.

## Create the data: two binary relations among three elements
arr <- round( replace( array( runif(18), c(3 ,3, 2) ), array( runif(18),
       c(3, 3, 2) ) > .9, 3 ) )

## Determine the system of strong bonds
rs <- rel.sys(arr, bonds = "strong")

## the inmediate neighbourhood of the first node
neighb(1, rs)
